Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell University, where I'm privileged to work with Nikhil Garg and Jon Kleinberg. 

I am broadly interested in topics at the intersection of computer science and economics / social science; my recent focus has been on understanding how factors such as human behavior, interpretability, and fairness affect the use and design of algorithmic systems.

I graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in math and computer science. At UBC, I had the opportunity to work on a research project in high-dimensional probability with [Yaniv Plan](https://www.yanivplan.com/) and [Özgür Yilmaz](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~oyilmaz/index.html), and a project in behavioral game theory with [Kevin Leyton-Brown](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kevinlb/) and [James R. Wright](https://jrwright.info/).
