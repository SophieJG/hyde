### Bio

Hi! I'm a first-year PhD student in computer science at Cornell University, where I'm privileged to work with Nikhil Garg and Jon Kleinberg. 

I graduated from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 2023 with a bachelor's degree in math and computer science. At UBC, I had the opportunity to do a summer research project in high-dimensional probability with Yaniv Plan and Ozgur Yilmaz, and later worked with Kevin Leyton-Brown and James R. Wright developing axioms for loss functions in behavioral game theory.
